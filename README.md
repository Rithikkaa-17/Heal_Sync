# Heal Sync - Intelligent Healing for Smart Implants
# Overview
It addresses the critical issue of post-surgery biomedical implant monitoring. By transforming implants from passive devices into intelligent healers, Heal Sync enables real-time health tracking and early detection of complications, dramatically improving patient outcomes.

# The Problem
Currently, 45-65% of implants face complications like infection or rejection due to a lack of continuous monitoring. This leads to costly, painful and risky revision surgeries.

# Our Solution
Heal Sync utilizes smart nanochips coated with an advanced MXene-gelatin hydrogel. These chips continuously monitor key parameters like temperature and strain, transmitting data wirelessly to a patient and doctor facing dashboard. This allows for proactive care, reducing complications and improving patient quality of life.

# Key Features
Real-time Monitoring: Continuous data from the implant site.

Biocompatible Hydrogel: Promotes up to 85% faster healing.

Early Detection: Reduces the risk of severe complications and re-surgeries.

Dual Dashboard: Provides intuitive health status for patients and detailed analytics for doctors.

# MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
Our MVP demonstrates the core functionality with a hardware prototype using an ESP32 microcontroller and a temperature sensor that sends real-time data to a web server. This confirms the feasibility of wireless data transmission for medical monitoring.

Next Steps
We are seeking partnerships with medical institutions and investors to move from a prototype to pilot studies and full-scale deployment.
